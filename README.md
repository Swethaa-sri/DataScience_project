# DataScience_Project :  Chennai house price prediction


Created a machine learning model model to understand the different factors that 
influence the price of a house in the city of chennai.

Based on the important factors consultations are given to the real estate developer.

Developed the entire model pipeline from data cleaning to interpretaion.

Tools :  python, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

The R-squared value is .9937, which is very close to 1. 
R-squared value very close to 1 means 100% of variance can be explained and such a model is very easily interpretable.
